So, let’s go right to the point of this article. Can EOS (EOS) overtake Ethereum (ETH)? The answer is simple, yes. But will it? Perhaps, and I will show you why.

这样，让我们开门见山的说出本文的观点。EOS是否可以以超越Ethereum(ETH)? 答案简单明了，可以。如果要问为什么，或许下面就是这些原因。

According to Coinmarketcap, EOS is the actual 9th largest cryptocurrency with its market capitalization reaching nearly 6 billion at its current price of about $8.15 USD per EOS token. However, over the past few weeks even with the dip in the cryptocurrency market, this cryptocurrency that was launched to trade around mid-last year, has exhibited some impressive level of stability since most other altcoins experienced a dizzily drop in price which gives EOS a more optimistic perspective.

根据现在市值排名EOS处于第9大加密货币，总市值60亿美元，单价大概在8.15美元左右。尽管在过去几个星期在加密货币市场价格有所下降，这支去年六月发行交易的加密货币的稳定性令人印象深刻，在其它加密货币经历的暴跌尤显EOS大有可为。


## What is EOS (EOS)?/ 什么是EOS?

It is basically a decentralized smart contract platform that provides an ecosystem for building decentralized applications (dApps). Touted as the fundamental solution to Blockchain’s thorny problems, EOS incorporates a delegated proof-of stake protocol that essentially acts like a community of dedicated delegates, responsible for transactional verification. Unlike traditional Blockchain, it claims that its Blockchain DPoS (Delegated Proof-of-stake) protocol is capable of higher transactional volume throughput with rates ranging as high as 100,000 transactions per second. Furthermore, it claims a capacity to tackle the issue of transactional fees that has been a problem since the rise of Bitcoin price. In fact, the coin proposes a zero-transactional fee using Horizontal scalability.

基本来说EOS是一个去中心化的智能合约平台，在这个平台生态中可创建分布式应用（DAPPs）。以建立棘手的区块链基础方案为卖点，采用 DPOS 协议，它的形式像社区选出专职代表来处理交易确认。据称利用DPOS 协议可提高交易量到100000/秒，同时有能力处理比特币的交易费用上涨问题。实际上利用其水平扩展的能力，平台提议免除使用费。


## The Team Backing EOS? / EOS背后团队?
Just the same way Ethereum is built on the Ethereum Blockchain so does EOS come with its own Blockchain called Block.one. Block.one is basically a Blockchain based platform that allows for the testing and creation of multiple decentralized apps. With the idea to create a programmable patchwork, the developers of Block.one including EOS CTO Dan Larimer, are pushing towards the developments of a proof of stake concept that will enable decentralization of autonomous organizations on the platform. In fact, Larimer is credit as the inventor of this revolutionary concept and boasts of a profound reputation in the crypto space.
就像Ethereum建立在Ethereum 区块链上一样，EOS也是建立在自己的区块链上，就是Block.one. Block.one 本质上是一个基础平台可在其上建立和测试去中心化的应用。包括Block.one CTO Dan Larimer 正在内的开发人员在推进开发权益证明和可编程修复概念，这些可支持在平台上建立去中心化的自治组织。事实上Dan Larimer 因为是这项颠覆性概念的发明者，而在加密领域有很高的声望。


## White Paper / 白皮书
The EOS.IO software introduces a new blockchain architecture designed to enable vertical and horizontal scaling of decentralized applications. This is achieved by creating an operating system-like construct upon which applications can be built. The software provides accounts, authentication, databases, asynchronous communication and the scheduling of applications across hundreds of CPU cores or clusters. The resulting technology is a blockchain architecture that scales to millions of transactions per second, eliminates user fees, and allows for quick and easy deployment of decentralized applications.
EOS.IO 软件展示一种新的区块链架构设计，使它可以使上面的去中心化应用进行横向和纵向扩展。这是因为它创建一种类似于操作系统的架构，在此基础上建立应用。软件提供了帐户，身份验证，数据库，异步通讯，以及通过对数百CPU 核心集群调度来实现应用的处理时间安排。这种技术的结果是产生可达数百万规模/秒处理能力的区块链，取消使用费用，可以快速简单的部署去中心化的应用。


## Background / 背景

Blockchain technology was introduced in 2008 with the launch of the bitcoin currency, and since then entrepreneurs and developers have been attempting to generalize the technology to support a wider range of applications on a single blockchain platform.

区块链技术通过比特币提出于2008年，从哪时以后企业家和开发者总在尝试推进这项技术，以实现更多的应用在一个区块链平台上运作。


## But can EOS (EOS) Really Take Down Ethereum (ETH)? / EOS真能超越Ethereum吗？

EOS has already had its fair share of attention with speculators mentioning its potential to outdo Ethereum thanks to the combination of Block.one and the EOS cryptocurrency. Certainly Ethereum has already established itself as the biggest Dapp platform in the crypto space and whether EOS and Block.one will manage to scale that height is unknown. However, if EOS can stand the test as the most powerful infrastructure for decentralized applications only time will tell us.

EOS已经得到了相当大的关注，许多思考者提到Block.one和EOS密货币的结合，并有可能超过Ethereum的潜力. 当然 Ethereum 已经在其加密平台上建立了最多数量的应用，是否EOS 将会达到这样的规模还未可知。 另外，是否EOS能以其强壮的基础设施经受住众多去中化应的运作，也只有时间才能给出答案了。


## Bitfinex to set up a Decentralized Exchange / Bitfinex将建立去中心化交易所

For instance, Bitfinex (a leading exchange in the crypto space) has just recently announced a move set up a decentralized exchange based on EOS’s Block.one Blockchain platform. The new decentralized exchange will go by the name EOSfinex and will not only enable scalability of EOS as a Dapp platform but also solve the age-old problem of decentralized exchanges that charge exorbitant transaction fees.

比如，Bitfnex (一家领先的加密货币交易所) 最近宣布要在Block.one平台上建立一家名为EOSfinex的去中心化的交易所，它将会是基于EOS的可升级的应用平台，另外也解决原去中心化平台交易费奇高的的问题。

J.L van der Velde (CEO of Bitfinex), said “I’m excited to leverage EOS.io to further advance the field of high performance and trustless on-chain exchange. Block.one continues to display an unwavering dedication to improving Blockchain scalability through the EOS.IO platform.”

威尔德（Bitfinex CEO）说，“我激动的宣布利用EOS.IO来推进高性能和免信任的区块链交易所。Block.one 通过EOS.IO扮演一个持续专注于改善区块链可升级性的基础平台。

This means that if the execution by Bitfinex becomes successful, and further development into the EOS platform is achieved, EOS (EOS) will be on its way to competing pound for pound with the big players of the crypto space and, of course, overtake ETH.

这就是说如果Bitfinex 的计划成功的话，这会促进发展EOS平台的结果，EOS会是在加密领域是的重要的选手，当然会超过ETH.
